# Survival_Analysis_Transformations
The aim of this project is to implement Cox survival model on several data transformations stored in a single TreeSummarizedExperiment plus alternativeExperiment data structure, for the purpose of evaluating whether different transformations affect model performance and lead to different outputs.
1. Install Required Packages
To facilitate reproducibility, this project relies on a Docker image that includes many of the required dependencies. Instructions for installing and running the Docker image can be found here:
https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/pages/session_info.html#sec-docker-image

Additionally, users should install any remaining R packages listed at the beginning of the script if they are not already installed.

2. The data on which the analysis is performed can be found in this repository "biom.Rdata".
