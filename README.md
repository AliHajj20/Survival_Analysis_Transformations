# Survival_Analysis_Transformations
The aim of this project is to implement Cox survival model on several data transformations stored in a single TreeSummarizedExperiment plus alternativeExperiment data structure, for the purpose of evaluating whether different transformations affect model performance and lead to different outputs.
